/**
 * Unit of Work for atomic control plane operations.
 *
 * <p>Ensures that entity state changes, domain events, and audit logs are
 * committed atomically within a single MongoDB transaction.
 *
 * <p><strong>This is the ONLY way to create a successful {@link Result}.</strong>
 * The {@link Result#success(Object)} method is package-private, so use cases
 * must go through UnitOfWork to return success. This guarantees that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Domain events are always emitted when state changes</li>
 *   <li>Audit logs are always created for operations</li>
 *   <li>Entity state and events are consistent (atomic commit)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage in a use case:
 * <pre>{@code
 * public Result<EventTypeCreated> execute(CreateEventTypeCommand cmd, ExecutionContext ctx) {
 *     // Validation - can return failure directly
 *     if (!isValid(cmd)) {
 *         return Result.failure(new ValidationError(...));
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create aggregate
 *     EventType eventType = new EventType(...);
 *
 *     // Create domain event
 *     EventTypeCreated event = EventTypeCreated.builder()
 *         .from(ctx)
 *         .eventTypeId(eventType.id)
 *         .build();
 *
 *     // Atomic commit - only way to return success
 *     return unitOfWork.commit(eventType, event, cmd);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This UnitOfWork is for control plane operations only.
 * {@link tech.flowcatalyst.event.EventService} and
 * {@link tech.flowcatalyst.dispatchjob.service.DispatchJobService} are leaf
 * operations that do not use this pattern (to avoid circular dependencies).
